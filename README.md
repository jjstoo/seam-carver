# seam-carver
OpenCV based utility for efficient content-aware scaling.
Includes a basic wrapper for user input but the main focus is on the functionality under the hood. Feel free to add any GUI bindings for easy usage.

Basic usage:

```Carver.run <mode: vertical/horizontal/both> <scale factor: 0-1> <input path> <output path>```

#### Example output when running in vertical mode
